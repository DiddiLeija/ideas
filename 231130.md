# Why I left GameOff 2023

_Sometimes you have to understand what you can do and what you can't. (November 30th 2023)._

Hi everyone! Today, I have to say it, it's a bittersweet day. And that's because I left **[GameOff 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gameoff-2023)**,
this year's edition of one of my very favorite game jams in the world. Don't worry, nothing weird/gross happened in the jam, I just decided to
leave because **I couldn't keep coding this time.** Let me explain you what happened.

Since 2021, I've been present in **GameOff** events. The jam consists in developing a game in a month (November), and release it to be
ranked by other jam members. In both 2021 and 2022, I'd say it was easy to me to make into the due date, and I published nice games
such as my now-stable **[Diddi and the Bugs](https://diddileija.itch.io/diddi-and-the-bugs)**. And this year, I thought it would be the same thing.

This time, however, some family business popped out, and I coded much slower than previous years. Also, I was overcoming a little
emocional breakdown, so it was a little hard for me to concentrate. All this factors combined left me being unable to finish my (ambitious) game
before the due date -- **November 30th (today)**.

I mean, by the time I'm publishing this post, **I could still code as fast as I could, just to release a minimal game. But I would end up without
strength and very, very stressed out, and I don't want that now.** So I decided to let it go, take my time, and see what happens next.
Maybe at some point you'll see my game released \(it's named **[Diddi and Eli](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and.eli)**\). Or, maybe, you'll see
me on the next GameOff event on 2024, or even in another jam!

By now, I can only say thanks to all those who supported me this month and gave me feedbacks of my WIPs. **Your support will not go unnoticed.**

See ya!
