# Inaugurating my Log (sort of)

_Hey, welcome to my articles feed!_
_(October 14th, 2023)._

Welcome to this new section, dubbed "DiddiLeija's Log". Just like a verbose-mode CLI, I'll be adding entries to my log (this section in my website)
as frequently as I want to, where I'll transfer thoughts, experiences, ideas, interviews (still not sure about this), etc.

This feed also serves to officially say goodbye to my old, deprecated [articles section](../articles). I wrote that section a while back to share my
"coding methods" and also to teach a bit about packaging and Python in general, I guess. However, my articles weren't the best in the world, and at some
point I decided to drop them. No more articles, I said. But then I wanted to express myself again in my website... and that's where "DiddiLeija's Log" enters.

So... here we are. Feel free to navigate across my articles, read them as many times as you want, and try out my methods. I hope you enjoy my articles,
have fun, and find some suggestions/ideas useful. I'll be working on that ;)
