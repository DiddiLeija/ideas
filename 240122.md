# DiddiLeija Tips for having a safe Discord server

_Do you have a growing Discord server? How to keep your community safe? (January 22th, 2023)._

## Intro

Being the owner of a Discord community is a great responsibility. You're in charge of a space people has
chosen to hang out, meet folks and share knowledge. Most of the time you don't have to do much,
but sometimes, you'll face a spammer, a rude user or something similar, and you have to take
the moderator hat.

I've seen that a few times. Some big, well-known servers where I've been have received spammish stuff,
inappropiate content, aggressive dudes, and other bad stuff at some point. I remember one time a bunch of spam
messages by a bot account got stuck on a server for almost 3 days. But why? Because **there was no moderation tools,
and the only moderator was unactive most of the time**.

In order to minimize the "bad behavior" incidences, and quickly smash the outcoming issues,
I'd suggest you to take 4 advices applicable to Discord servers (though some of them are universal tips lol).

## Tip 1: Set up a moderation bot/integration

Moderation bots are great. Mostly because they're always online (unlike human moderators), and you can set them
up to automatically detect rude stuff. Also, some bots have enabled text commands (e.g. `/report @badguy`) that
can be used by all users in order to report bad behavior or request timeouts. Always consult the bot docs to learn
how to set it up to your needs.

In my own usecase, I've been using [YAGPDB.xyz](https://yagpdb.xyz/), a easy-to-use bot for basic moderation.

## Tip 2: Trust in a few extra moderators to help you out

This is a great idea when you have a lot of members in the server. Pick up users you trust, and have demonstrated
to be fair and nice with other folks. Consider having them on a role upper to most of the users, but
below you (so you can keep everything under control if needed, just in case). You can also teach you co-moderators
to interact with moderation bots (if you followed Tip 1, described above).

## Tip 3: Set up a `#rules` channel or something similar

IMHO, this one is vital to prevent unintended rudeness (though it can't help against intended attackers). If all
your users can read what's expected from them while on the server, they will be more careful and even help or remind
other users to follow the rules.

Channel names such as `#rules` or `#checklist` are great to attract the atention of newcomers.

In addition of sharing the server rules, you can also explain what can users do when they find something wrong, who
can they call, and if there's any exception to a rule.

## Tip 4: If you don't want agressive comments in your server, don't be agressive yourself!

This is the most intuitive tip I can give. In Mexico, we call that **"predicar con el ejemplo" ("preach by example")**.
Again, this would only work against unintended behavior, but I believe it can always help.

## Outro

Of course, there's no way to avoid _all_ the rude behavior that could pop into your server. But by following these 4 easy steps,
you can reduce the incidents, and make your server a nice place for everyone, everytime :)
