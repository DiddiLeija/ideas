# The 2023 recap!

_A quick recap on my activity this 2023 (January 4th, 2023)._

As the 2023 ends and we get started with 2024, it's a nice moment to reconsider what I've been doing
in the past year. Some of the events have been important and great, some have been sad or hard
to overcome, but all of them conform my 2023 after all, and I would like to share them with y'all.

### A personal breakdown?

During the first part of 2023, I was fighting for a ticket to a very important national competition
of coding. And though I gave it all, in the end I lost in favor of faster, more experienced coders.
Honestly, that left me a little unstable, and eventually that was reflected in my activity.

If you take a closer look into my stats \(such as my [GitHub skyline](https://skyline.github.com)
or directly from my [profile](https://github.com/DiddiLeija)\), you'll see my activity decreased
drastically between **March and Setptember**. I'd say that's not a coincidence, because between those
months I was busy treating my complex emotions. Eventually, from **September to now**, after some
professional atention, I felt much better, so I returned to my normal activity.

### [Diddi and the Bugs 3.1.1](https://diddileija.itch.io/diddi-and-the-bugs/devlog/517218/version-311) dropped and [v4 development](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/milestone/1) started!

One of my best games I've ever made is [**Diddi and the Bugs**](https://diddileija.itch.io/diddi-and-the-bugs), a shooter game
that has progressed since its creation, back in 2021. Though this year we didn't drop any major releases, I had the chance to
release version 3.1.1, the final bugfix for the 3.x series.

In 2023, we started to develop a new major version:
[**version 4.0**](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/milestone/1) -- containing brand new features such
as [skin packs](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/issues/137),
a new [Special Attack](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/issues/115),
the introduction of [Pyxel v2](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/pull/158),
and much, much more.

But there's even another accomplishment that I'm so proud of. This year, **two new contributors** joined
the project on GitHub! As a project owner/manager, I'm so happy to see my project receiving help from
other people!

### I finally cleaned up my [website](https://DiddiLeija.github.io).

Yup, I finally made [a deep refactor](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/DiddiLeija.github.io/issues/22) on my website.
I feel that it now feels much cleaner, accurate, and it's easier to navigate it. Since that site is a sort
of "presentation letter" as a developer, it's very important to keep it clean.

And I also created [the log](.), this binnacle you're visiting today. I hope to write a lot of articles
this 2024!

### I almost made it into the [GameOff 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) event!

My initial goal was to submit a game to this year's GameOff jam. And I almost made it, and created
an ambitious platformer named [**Diddi and Eli**](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-eli). But
due to some personal stuff, my schedule was moved and I didn't release the game. I even wrote
[an article](231130) explaining the reasons.

But the development of Diddi and Eli won't be over. I hope to release a polished version of the game
around this year, but probably outside of a jam. Also, I would love to join GameOff 2024!

### And finally, I started my crusade of learning the fundamentals of AI...

This might be the most recent event. In December, during a vacational period, I started a course
about AI fundamentals. I decided to take on that course because AI technologies are a quite
relevant area in the world of programming. So i created an [ai-fundamentals](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/ai-fundamentals)
repo to upload my models as I create them, and to share that progress with the world.
